# BadDopoCream
This is our final project for our object oriented class (Desarrollo orientado por objetos - DOPO). It consist of our own version of the online game Bad Ice Cream. In this case, we are coding all of it using java and aslo using eclipse as our IDE.
The architecture used for the project is the MVC (model-view-controller) so all the logic of the program is stored in the package domain, the GUI is the package presentation and we also have a tests package inn which we developed unit test to cerify that all functionalities work.
